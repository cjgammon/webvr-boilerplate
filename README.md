# webvr-template
This is a template project for webVR. I use this to get going rather quickly for webVR related projects and experiments that work across different devices and situations.

It utilizes `webvr-polyfill` to work on mobile devices with a headset. It also works in webvr enabled browsers with a headset like the vive. There is also a fallback mouse/keyboard non-vr experience.

Blender is used to create the scene. You can update and export the included .blender file and it will use it for the scene.

### installation
